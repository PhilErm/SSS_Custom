# Exploring sea sparing and sharing with a custom model

A model for exploring sea sparing and sharing in a spatially explicit setting for three species.

## How to use

1. Adjust parameters in 'parameters.R'.
2. Run simulations and generate output figures by running entirety of 'runModel.R'.

## To-dos

* Move replicated code into functions.
* Account for negative population sizes.
* Rebuild dispersal functionality.
* Build alternative catch model.
* Review habitat damage function.
